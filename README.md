# Presenting: BeSustainable

## What I built 👷

A privacy-aware platform that will make people more environmentally conscious. _Users_ will be able to _Report_ anything they think needs an intervention (e.g. Trash on the park or beach, a water pipe leaking, garbage containers constant overflows). Each user will have an amount of _Reputation_ which they can use to _Endorse_ these _Reports_. Eventually, the _Reports_ can turn into _Events_ that will deal with the problem, rewarding the user with more _Reputation_ to _Endorse_. 
> But above all, we will be rewarding mankind by making our planet better bit by bit.

## Background 🔍
Last year showed us some great things: the Human will achieve anything; Nature is always willing to come back in full glory.

This second point is the one that strikes me the most. To see just how quickly Nature can change and adapt. From all around the world we saw drops in carbon emissions, an increase in the air quality in cities, increased water quality of rivers and lakes. Nature is just around the corner trying to restore the balance in our planet. For me, it was about time we help it achieve it.

### How I built it ⚙️

- Using Python and Django I was able to quickly prototype what a platform like this would look like.
- Learned a bit about [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) in order to provide the users with a easy way to login to the platform without the need for a Sign In form.
    - Google and Digital Ocean are options to Login
- A splash of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make it pretty
- Used [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/) to provide me with map information completely for free!
- Hacked [geohashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) into submission to have all the features I wanted without hassle
- The Digital Ocean platform was a breeze to use! Followed this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-django-to-app-platform) and used 3 components:
    - A main component to deploy the Django App
    - One to serve the static assets
    - A Dev database to store the data
Overall very impressed with the service! However, since I have 3 components I could not add the "deploy to Digital Ocean button" because it had some service and component limits 😔

I presented a more in-depth analysis of my findings and pain points in [here](https://dev.to/ludeed/the-execution-5dg9)

### Additional Resources/Info

Great job from the organizers, from getting the credits to the platform to the platform itself, very nice hackathon


See you next year(?) and until then... BeSustainable 🌳
